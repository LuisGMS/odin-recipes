        <li>5 whole eggs</li>
        <li>½ fresh jalapeno or serrano</li>

        <li>Whisk eggs in a bowl first and set to side.</li>
        <li>After the mixture of onion, serrano pepper, and tomato saute, you’ll add your cubed leftover ham to the pan just for long enough to warm</li>
        <li>Once eggs are added, allow to cook for about 30 seconds (i know, patience gotta build) before scrambling in gently.</li>
        <li>Once cooked transfer that fine looking egg ham scramble carefully into a platter and cover to retain warmth and moisture.</li>
        <li>That's it!</li>
